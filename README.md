## 👾 Exercises
In all exercises, create a project with a Main class that demonstrates the use of the pattern (with the necessary invocations).

### 📌 Level 1 - Singleton
Create a class that replicates the operation of the 'Undo' command. This class will be used by the Main class, which will allow you to enter options via console.

The 'Undo' class must save the last commands entered. It must allow you to add or delete commands, as well as list the last commands entered (similar to the 'history' command in Linux).
The 'Undo' class must implement a Singleton pattern.


### 📌 Level 2 - Abstract Factory 
Create a small manager of international addresses and phone numbers.
The application should allow adding international addresses and phone numbers to the address book. 
Taking into account the different formats of different countries, build the address book, addresses and phones by implementing an Abstract Factory pattern.

### 📌 Level 3 - Command
Design a parking lot for 4 vehicles: a car, a bicycle, a plane, and a boat.
Show how the Command pattern works, implementing the start, accelerate, and brake methods for each type of vehicle.
